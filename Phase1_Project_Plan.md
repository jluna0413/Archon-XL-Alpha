Phase 1 — Analysis & Strategic Plan

Purpose

Produce a concise, actionable Phase 1 deliverable: ingest all documents in /Tecnical_Docs, extract scope/requirements/constraints, propose a technology stack and architecture, and deliver a sprint-level timeline + acceptance criteria for approval.

Checklist (requirements)

- [x] Ingest and analyze all files in `Tecnical_Docs`
- [x] Produce Phase 1 written plan (this document)
- [ ] Create Archon project record (attempted; MCP timeout)
- [ ] Create Archon review task (attempted; MCP timeout)
- [ ] Persist critical facts to Byterover memory (attempted)

Executive summary

Archon-XL-Alpha is an extensible, plugin-based agentic platform that integrates:
- Model Context Provider (MCP) tooling and mcp-agent integrations
- Persistent memory (Byterover), vector search (Qdrant)
- Visual UI automation via Aether / Mobile-Agent (Aether Control Plane)
- Secure sandboxed execution (Cipher)
- Workflow orchestration (Sim.AI) and a web UI (Next.js + React)

Proposed technology stack (justification mapped to docs)

- Backend: Python 3.11+ (FastAPI preferred; Flask is acceptable). Rationale: docs reference FastAPI for OpenMemory; Python ecosystem works well with mcp-agent and Celery.
- Workflow engine: Celery + Redis for distributed task execution (docs suggest Celery+Redis).
- Database: PostgreSQL for relational metadata (users, workflows, runs). Docs include Postgres SQL schemas.
- Vector DB / Memory: Qdrant for embeddings + Postgres for metadata (OpenMemory pattern).
- Agent / MCP layer: mcp-agent + Gemini (or configurable LLM per ADRs).
- Frontend: TypeScript + React (Next.js) with Redux for dashboard state (OpenMemory and Sim.AI examples).
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions (standard enterprise pipeline). Docker Compose for local dev; containerized services (Postgres, Qdrant, API, UI).
- Testing: pytest for Python, vitest/Jest for frontend; Cypress / Playwright for e2e.
- Security & Sandbox: Cipher plugin approach for ephemeral sandboxing of executed code; follow OpenMemory security notes (auditing, ACLs).

Scope & constraints discovered in the docs

- MCP is central: all agents and UI interactions must be context-aware and use standardized MCP tools.
- Visual automation requires an "Aether Control Plane" microservice and emulator farm; plan must include an emulator orchestration design and artifact storage.
- Privacy-first memory: Byterover/OpenMemory runs locally/dockerized and requires ACLs, audit logs, TTL policies.
- Plugin-based architecture is mandated by ADRs. Clear plugin API and enable/disable behavior required.
- Code style and linting: Python (Black, flake8), Frontend (Airbnb + Prettier + ESLint) must be enforced.

High-level architecture

- Archon Core (API + UI) — manages users, plugins, workflows
- Workflow Engine (Celery + Redis) — executes workflow graphs, invokes plugin nodes
- Plugins — Aether (Visual Automation), Byterover (Memory), Cipher (Sandbox), ART/MCP-RL (training), Sim.AI (workflow nodes)
- Aether Control Plane — separate microservice to provision emulators and produce artifacts (video, logs)
- Storage — Postgres (metadata), Qdrant (vectors), object storage for artifacts (S3-compatible)
- Observability — Prometheus + Grafana for metrics; structured logs forwarded to ELK/Opensearch

Sprint-level timeline (proposal)

- Sprint 0 (1 week): Repo & infra bootstrap
  - Initialize Git repo, CI workflow, Docker Compose skeleton
  - Create initial pyproject.toml/package.json templates and pre-commit hooks
  - Deliverable: repo with README, CI pipeline, and dev env scripts

- Sprint 1 (3 weeks): Core backend & plugin framework
  - Implement Archon Core minimal API (auth, plugin registry)
  - Define plugin interface and a sample plugin scaffold
  - Deliverable: Auth endpoints, plugin API spec, sample plugin

- Sprint 2 (4 weeks): Workflow engine + Byterover memory
  - Wire Celery tasks, Postgres schemas (from docs), Qdrant integration
  - Implement Byterover / OpenMemory patterns (memory add/search/list)
  - Deliverable: Working memory service + sample RAG flow

- Sprint 3 (4 weeks): Frontend shell + Sim.AI integration
  - Implement Next.js UI shell (Nav / Settings / Dashboard)
  - Integrate workflow builder palette (Sim.AI nodes mapping)
  - Deliverable: Basic UI and run/workflow listing

- Sprint 4 (4 weeks): Visual Automation (Aether) & emulation control plane
  - Implement Aether Control Plane API, emulator provisioning, artifactory
  - Plugin: Mobile-Agent client tools (create_session, execute_task)
  - Deliverable: End-to-end demo: generate code -> deploy to emulator -> capture artifact

- Sprint 5 (3 weeks): Beta testing, security hardening, docs
  - Run E2E tests, security audits (cipher sandbox), user testing, fix backlog
  - Deliverable: Beta release, deployment scripts, runbook

Acceptance criteria (Phase 1/initial milestone)

- All technical docs ingested and summarized (this file + notes)
- Repo initialized with CI, linter config, and pre-commit hooks
- Archon Core skeleton API runs locally (health endpoint)
- Plugin interface defined and one scaffold plugin available
- Byterover memory blueprint and database schemas implemented locally (migrations present)

Risks and mitigation

- Aether infra cost/complexity: mitigate with lab-based emulator pool initially (smaller scale), then scale to cloud when proven.
- Security for code execution: enforce sandboxing via Cipher, RBAC, audit logs, and ephemeral credentials.
- LLM/API costs: use configurable model backends and local caching for repeated calls.

Next actions (short)

1. Request approval for the Phase 1 plan (confirm stack and timeline).
2. Initialize Git repo and push an initial commit with this plan.
3. Create CI pipeline and local Docker Compose skeleton.
4. Re-attempt Archon MCP project/task creation and Byterover memory store once credentials are available.

Notes on MCP/Byterover/Archon interactions

- I attempted to call Archon MCP to create a project and task; these attempts timed out (API read timeout).
- I attempted to retrieve Byterover knowledge but request failed due to authentication; storing knowledge will be attempted next.

## Repo status
- Git repository initialized and initial commit created: `main` branch.
- Files added: README, Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, .gitignore, CI workflow, pre-commit config, FastAPI scaffold, plugin base, migrations SQL.
